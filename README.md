Three.js Doodads
================

[Three.js][1] is pretty *damn* awesome, and this here is a little chrome-packaged app that I made to showcase
some experiements that I've been playing with.

## Running
  1. Navigate to [chrome://extensions][2].
  2. Check the **"Enable Developer Mode"** checkbox if it isn't already selected.
  3. Click the **"Load Unpacked Extension..."** button, and select the directory that contains the `manifest.json` file.
  4. Click the _Launch_ link to launch the app in a chrome sandbox.
